This repository is created for my 'beloved' DSE friends who gonna attend Python and Data management exams. 

A. Python folder is forked from repository of Prof. Bianchi together with all lecture videos. You can find also the questions on 2020 exams on the Exam_collection folder. P/s: Do know the structure of the exam from the previous ones to have correct strategy. The last question is a theory one in which you should know the mathematic formula. 

B. SQL exam is actually pgAdmin 4 exam. You can study L1, L2, L3, L4 file. Do extra exercises on L5 and practice queries in Practice-Queries file. If you have enough time, check L0.a and L0.b. I don't remember what they are but its fine if you skip them. You can find also the questions on 2020 exams on the Exam_collection folder. P/s: Check Exam_collection folder. During the exam, be careful with multiple-choice questions.. don't make mistake as me :D

C. NoSQL is simple, not much to say.. anyway Practice makes perfect. Thus, learn by heart 4 jason files. Check Exam_collection folder for previous exam questions. 

Good luck!
